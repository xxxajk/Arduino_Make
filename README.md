Arduino_Make
=======================

Use make on macos Darwin or linux instead of arduino IDE.

```
Requires:
  Arduino 1.6.7 or newer to be installed, and to manage installed boards.
  GNU Make

NOTE:
  Even though arduino builder does a lot for you...
    * If your sketch (.ino) does not compile because YOU did not include Arduino.h or 
    * then YOU need to fix YOUR code.
    * YOU need to also properly do all function prototypes as well.
    * Avoid problems! Do your code the proper way from the start.

Features:
  Supports all boards that are installed.
  Seperated build output for each target.
```
